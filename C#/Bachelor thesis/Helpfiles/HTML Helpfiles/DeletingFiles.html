          To delete files just check the file(s) in the datagridview, or rightclick -> Deletion<br />
          You can set several files in several folders for deletion. No files are deleted until you press the button.
        </div>
        <br />
        <br />
        When it comes to deleting files, as with folders, you have two different options,<br />
        move the file(s) to the Recycle Bin or delete the file(s) permanently.
        <br />
        <br />
        The difference between moving the file(s) to the Recycle Bin and deleting the file(s) permanently<br />
        is that with the Recycle Bin you can choose to restore the deleted file(s).<br />
        Deleting the file(s) permanently means just that - the file(s) are gone forever and not restorable.        
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />

        <br />
        <br />
        You should also know that you can only move OR delete a file, meaning
        that a file can't be selected for both moving or deleting,  <br />
        but you can select several files for both moving and deletion at the same time,
        but no action will be taken until corresponding<br />
        button is pressed.
