        Copyright &copy; 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <a href="http://fsf.org/">&lt;http://fsf.org/&gt;</a><br />
        Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies <br />
        of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <center>Preamble</center>
        <br />
        <br />
        The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for <br />
        software and other kinds of works. <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed <br />
        to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast, <br />
        the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to <br />
        share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free <br />
        software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the <br />
        GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to <br />
        any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to <br />
        your programs, too.
        <br />
        <br />
        When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not <br />
        price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you <br />
        have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for <br />
        them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you <br />
        want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new <br />
        free programs, and that you know you can do these things. <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you <br />
        these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have <br />
        certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if <br />
        you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others. <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether <br />
        gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same  <br />
        freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive <br />
        or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they <br />
        know their rights.
        <br />
        <br />
        Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: <br />
        (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License <br />
        giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.
        <br />
        <br />
        For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains <br />
        that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and <br />
        authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as <br />
        changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to <br />
        authors of previous versions.
        <br />
        <br />
        Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run<br />
        modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer <br />
        can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of  <br />
        protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic<br />
        pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to <br />
        use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we<br />
        have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those<br />
        products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we <br />
        stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions <br />
        of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.<br />
        <br />
        <br />
        Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.<br />
        States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of <br />
        software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to <br />
        avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could <br />
        make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that <br />
        patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.
