        When it comes to deleting folders, as with files, 
        you have two different options.<br />
        Move the folder to the Recycle Bin or delete the folder permanently.<br />
        Due note that this will delete both the selected folder and all its content 
        (<i>subfolders and files</i>).
        <br />
        <br />
        The difference between moving the folder to the Recycle Bin and deleting the folder permanently<br />
        is that with the Recycle Bin you can choose to restore the deleted folder(s).<br /> 
        Deleting a folder permanently means just that - the folder and its content is gone forever, and not restorable.
        <br />
        <br />
        That' why you can only delete folder(s) when running fullscans.<br />
        This is a pre-caution to avoid deleting folders that may seem empty<br /> 
        (<i>moved/deleted by CleanMyFolder, or files that weren't included in the scan</i>) though,<br /> 
        if a specified scan has been run, it's not necessarily all the folders content is being displayed.<br />
        When running a specified scan, the buttons for deletion of folders will be disabled.

        <!--Example to give an description of why deletion is disabled-->
        <u>An example to get a better understanding:</u>
        <br />
        <br />
        Let's say you scan a folder which basically is used for camera/picture files.<br />
        So, you check the extension scan and select 'Pictures'.<br /> 
        Further on, after getting the result, you move the files to a new location or memory stick.<br />
        Then, thinking the folder is empty, you delete it.<br />
        But, what if that folder also contained some movies?<br />
        Some short stuff taken with a cellphone or digital camera.<br /> 
        They would be gone for good if that folder got deleted.
        <br />
        <br />
        But, if you want to delete a folder, you can also just simply choose 'Open folder',<br /> 
        check if it's empty and then just delete it normally by using Windows Explorer.
