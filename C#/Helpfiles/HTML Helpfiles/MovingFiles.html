        To move files just check the file(s) in the datagridview, or rightclick
        and select the option fitting:
        <br />
        <br />
        <!--images-->
        <div id="image">
          <!--image of rightclick datagridview - move-->
          <img src="Images/Move_Datagridview.jpg" /><br />
          Rightclicking move in datagridview
        </div>
        <br />
        <br />
        You can select several files in several folders, but due note that all 
        the selected  will be moved to the same location when clicking 'Move files'.<br />
        Do note that the 'Space that will be available' may be inaccurate when it comes to
        selecting files to be moved.<br /> 
        If the files are moved to a new location within the same 
        drive, no space will be earned.
        <br />
        <br />
        You should also know that you can only move OR delete a file, meaning
        that a file can't be selected for both moving or deleting,  <br />
        but you can select several files for both moving and deletion at the 
        same time, but no action will be taken until corresponding button is pressed.
        <br />
        <br />
        <u>Note:</u>
        <br />
        <br />
        If you decide to move several files, and some are of a certain size, and you decide it takes to long, 
        or for some other reason cancel the move, <br /> 
        it's recommended that you re-scan the selected path to avoid in-accurate file listings.
